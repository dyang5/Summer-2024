Monday, July 8th
\begin{itemize}
    \item More trials on $Fl(1, 3, 4)$. Updated Grothendieck Jamboard.
\end{itemize}

Point of Discussion for Tuesday, July 9th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will want to discuss $F_{2, 2}$/what to do in universal substitution, as well as making sure ideals are set up correctly
    \item Discuss how to make more informed guesses
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 9th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda. More trials on $Fl(1, 3, 4)$ (along with guesses from exterior algebras)
    \item Fixed $F$ substitution in (3.8), created functions to test for symmetries in Grothendiecks, and that the defined Grothendiecks are the same as their classical versions when $q$ terms are set to $0$
\end{itemize}

Wednesday, July 10th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added some tables for elementary symmetric monomials, $f/F$, and $\overline{E}/\hat{E}$ terms in $Fl(4)$
    \item Continue modifying guesses/fix code
    \item Think about why non-$q$-relations are failing even when classical Grothendiecks are recovered
    \item To do: think about different substitutions for $F_{i, j}$ and create quantum Schubert tables for $Fl(1, 2, 4)$ and $Fl(1, 3, 4)$.
\end{itemize}

Thursday, July 11th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pivoting to work back on quantum schubert calculator: debugged/corrected quantum Schubert in partial flags program
    \item Added quantum Schubert tables for $Fl(1, 2, 4)$ and $Fl(1, 3, 4)$
    \item Start to think about how to implement Quantum Monk in partial flags and begin documentation
\end{itemize}

Friday, July 12th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Work through Example 2 in Buch Partial Flag paper, prepare for Quantum Pieri for quantum schuberts in Partial Flags
    \item Met with Zoe briefly to discuss progress
    \item Started documentation for quantum schuberts
\end{itemize}
