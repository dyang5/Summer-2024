Monday, July 8th
\begin{itemize}
    \item More trials on $Fl(1, 3, 4)$. Updated Grothendieck Jamboard.
\end{itemize}

Point of Discussion for Tuesday, July 9th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will want to discuss $F_{2, 2}$/what to do in universal substitution, as well as making sure ideals are set up correctly
    \item Discuss how to make more informed guesses
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 9th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda. More trials on $Fl(1, 3, 4)$ (along with guesses from exterior algebras)
    \item Fixed $F$ substitution in (3.8), created functions to test for symmetries in Grothendiecks, and that the defined Grothendiecks are the same as their classical versions when $q$ terms are set to $0$
\end{itemize}
