Monday, July 15th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Revisit quantum Grothendiecks in Grassmanian cases ($Gr(1, 3), Gr(2, 3)$)
    \item Created multiplication tables with Monk rules for each Grassmanian case
    \item Updated Dropbox with proper code
\end{itemize}

Points of Discussion for Tuesday, July 16th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss how the two Grassmanian cases are different
    \item Discuss what is already known in terms of Grassmanians

Meeting Notes for Tuesday, July 16th:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conjectural representation for grassmannians that is not like what we've been looking at
    \item What do we know about the Grassmannian?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Grothendieck polynomials (Buch). Products. 
        \item Same software works for guesses + stuff
    \end{itemize}
    \item (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) (maybe will give more insight into skipping a number)
    \item Can also try (1,2,4) -- fewer relations between the f's
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 16th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continue exploring quantum Grothendiecks in $Gr(2, 4)$
    \item Made some edits to \texttt{updated\_guessing\_code.txt} and f substitution process
\end{itemize}

Wednesday, July 17th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Off day for NYC trip
    \item Finalized guesses for $Gr(1, 4), Gr(2, 4), Gr(3, 4)$, will work tomorrow to confirm that they work as intended and compare to full flag cases
\end{itemize}

Thursday, July 18th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confirm guesses for $Gr(1, 4), Gr(2, 4), Gr(3, 4)$ in Grassmanians file
    \item Further experimentation on $Fl(1, 2, 4)$ and working to find a guess
\end{itemize}
