\subsection{Weekly Summary}

Monday, June 10th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coded our own implementation of Grothendieck polynomials, with isobaric divided difference operator, in Sage
    \item Begin looking into connections between Schurs, Schuberts, and Grothendiecks
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, June 11th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda, discussed Quantum Schuberts in full flags (matrix determinant approach and with Dynkin diagrams)
    \item Formalized project direction (work on understanding Quantum Schuberts in partial flags, extend to defining Quantum Grothendiecks in partial flags, Monk formula)
\end{itemize}
