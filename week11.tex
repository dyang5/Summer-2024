\begin{itemize}
    \item Found some errors in conjecture for $Fl(2, 3, 4), Fl(2, 3, 5)$
    \item Switched to working on coding $\tau$ terms and Whitney conjecture
    \item To-do: check Whitney conjecture $F_p^k$ for all flags with ambient space $4, 5$
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 30th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Checked Whitney conjecture $F_p^k$ for all flags with ambient space $4, 5$
    \item Worked on rewriting $F_p^k$ without fraction terms, yielding new recursion with $\tau$ terms
    \item Completed code to write any $F_p^k$ using above recursion
    \item Starting more writing/wrap-up of current research direction
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 30 Meeting Notes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can use macaulay to make code faster, Or Groebner package
    \item Start writing --> file under write-ups in dropbox. Edit whatever sections and then upload with a name and date. 
    \item Linda can do the quantum k-theory section. I can do grothendiecks with divided difference operators. With references
    \item Write up section on quantum k-theory 
\end{itemize}
