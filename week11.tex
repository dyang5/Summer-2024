\begin{itemize}
    \item Found some errors in conjecture for $Fl(2, 3, 4), Fl(2, 3, 5)$
    \item Switched to working on coding $\tau$ terms and Whitney conjecture
    \item To-do: check Whitney conjecture $F_p^k$ for all flags with ambient space $4, 5$
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 30th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Checked Whitney conjecture $F_p^k$ for all flags with ambient space $4, 5$
    \item Worked on rewriting $F_p^k$ without fraction terms, yielding new recursion with $\tau$ terms
    \item Completed code to write any $F_p^k$ using above recursion
    \item Starting more writing/wrap-up of current research direction
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 30 Meeting Notes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can use Macaulay to make code faster, Or Groebner package
    \item Start writing, add file under write-ups in dropbox. Edit whatever sections and then upload with a name and date. 
    \item Linda can do the quantum k-theory section. I can do grothendiecks with divided difference operators. With references
    \item Write up section on quantum k-theory 
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 31st
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed small errors in $F_p^k$ whitney conjecture
    \item Revisited previous conjecture for closed form $F_p^k$ and found that they match Whitney conjecture!
    \item Experimented with Grobener Bases. Next, experiment with Macalauy to see if modulo ideal relations are any faster/less computationally expensive
    \item More discussion and edits on writeups
\end{itemize}

Wednesday, July 31 Meeting Notes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Goal: Prove our closed form conjecture from $F_p^k$ satisfies the conjectured Whitney Recursion
    \item Stretch Goal: maybe prove Chevalley? Probably not a lot of time to do it
    \item Writing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recursion: weird thing about combining wedges and F's. So replace $\tau$ with $\gamma$ and replace $F$ with $C$. That is, define $\tau$s and $\gamma$s.  
        \item Use induction to prove the second formulation of the recursion (Zoe)
        \item Clean up the recursion (Zoe)
        \item Write up grothendiecks/universal grothendiecks + divided difference operators
        \item Show that our guesses satisfy the recursion (Zoe)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
