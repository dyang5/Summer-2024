Monday, July 1st
\begin{itemize}
    \item Begin experimentation with $Fl(3)$ relations, set up QKMonk for $Fl(1, 2, 4)$ and $Fl(1, 3, 4)$
    \item Need to debug c substitution routine (see ideal testing)
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 2nd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Meeting with Linda to discuss ``guessing'' quantum grothendiecks in partial flags
    \item More setup for guessing code
    \item Start working through $Fl(3)$ example, with $\overline{E}, F,$ and $E$ expressions
\end{itemize}

Point of Discussion for Tuesday, July 2nd Meeting
\begin{itemize}
    \item Review Universal Grothendieck and substitution process (example for full flag case/is it known)
    \item Need to redefine quotient ideal for partial flag ($\overline{E}$ definition may be different)
    \item Working through relations problem with Maple code (review algebraic formulation of QK ring)
\end{itemize}


Ideas for a partial flag quantization map:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Same thing as 3.1 but with $i \in I$ and $i \in $ the partial flag
\end{itemize}

Wednesday, July 3rd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up Maple functions for testing
    \item Promising initial guess (using only elements in partial flag) -- later found a bug in the code
\end{itemize}

Thursday, July 4th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Revisit example from previous day
    \item Make modifications to code, including adding check relations function
    \item Confirm working behavior for $Fl(3)$ case
    \item Prepare for meeting, add questions and points of discussion below
\end{itemize}

Point of Discussion for Friday, July 5th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Review $F$ terms -- what $q$ terms do they include? (discuss full flag case as well)
    \item How should we change $k$ in a partial flag (any ideas)?
    \item Show setup -- checking relations with new function, setting up ideal, and non-recursive definitions of $F, \hat{E}$, and $\overline{E}$
    \item Should do $Fl(2)$, $E$, $E$ bar, $E$ hat, $G$'s
\end{itemize}

Friday, July 5th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda to discuss progress and further guessing
    \item Important to check symmetries in a given partial flag (e.g. $F_1^3$ should be symmetric in $x_2$ and $x_3$ under the partial flag $Fl(1, 2, 4)$
\end{itemize}
