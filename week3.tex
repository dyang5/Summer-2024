\subsection{Weekly Summary}

Monday, June 3rd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked through Sheet 3 (Schubert polynomials introduction, Schubert polynomials in $Fl(3)$, relating Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{S}$ in the basis of Schubert polynomials with partitions and Schur polynomials).
    \item Read potential projects background
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, June 4th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda, talked about Sheet 3 (addressing sheet 3 problems and potential projects)
    \item Started working through potential projects warmup problems, including quantum Schubert polynomials and reading through Buch (Quantum Homology)
\end{itemize}

Wednesday, June 5th
\begin{itemize}
    \item Working on warmup problem exercise. Tried Quantum schubert multiplication with Quantum Pieri (not much success), found answer using Quantum Monk (need to check by hand)
    \item Reading Buch and Lenart-Maeno articles
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Points of Dicussion for June 4th, Tuesday Meeting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we determine a basis of Schubert polynomials for a general flag manifold?
    \item How can we reconcile the Schubert polynomials with the Schurs (which permutations correspond to which partitions)?
    \item For project 2: Which properties are we looking to preserve under the essential set analog?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reconciling (some) Schubert polynomials with Schurs}
When we refer to the complete flag manifold $Fl(1, 2, 3, 4)$, observe that the Schubert polynomials correspond to permutations of $S_4$, and so $S_4$ is in some sense the basis for the flag manifold:
\[
    Fl(1, 2, 3, 4) \leftrightarrow S_4
\]
In general, for a flag manifold $Fl(n_1, n_2, \dots, n)$, we find that the ``basis'' corresponds to a subset of permutations of $S_n$:
\[
    Fl(n_1, n_2, \dots, n) \leftrightarrow \{ w \in S_n \mid w \text{ has descents } \subseteq \{ n_1, n_2, \dots, n\} \}
\]

Take the specific case of $Gr(2, 4) = Fl(2, 4)$. The basis corresponds to permutations 
$w \in S_4 \mid w \text{ has descent possibly at $2$}$; the permutations in said basis are simply $[1\, 2 \mid 3 \,4]$, $[1\,3 \mid 2\,4]$, $[1\, 3 \mid 2\,4]$, $[1\,4 \mid 2\,3]$, $[2\,3 \mid 1\,4]$, $[2\,4 \mid 1\,3]$, and $[3\,4 \mid 1\,2]$. \\

There is an association between the Schubert polynomials corresponding to each of these permutations and an associated Schur polynomial, characterized by the following rule: let $w = w_1 w_2 \dots w_n$. 
\begin{quote}
\textit{If $w_i < w_{i+1}$ for all $i \neq r$ (i.e. there is just one descent at index $r$), $\mathfrak{S}_w$ is the Schur polynomial $s_\lambda(x_1, \dots, x_r)$, where $\lambda = (w_r - r, \dots, w_2 - 2, w_1 - 1)$.}
\end{quote}

The above rule is extremely useful for identifying Schuberts as Schurs. For example, consider the Schubert polynomial corresponding to the permutation $[2\,4 \mid 1\,3]$. There is a descent at index $2$, and so $\lambda = (w_2 - 2, w_1 - 1) = (4 - 2, 2 - 1) = (2, 1)$ and
\[
    \mathfrak{S}_{[2\,4 \mid 1\,3]} = s_{(2, 1)}(x_1, x_2).
\]

The same rule applies for other permutations with one descent. For example, 
\[
    \mathfrak{S}_{[2 \mid 1\,3\,4]} = s_{(1)}(x_1).
\]
In particular, the rule also helps us realize that all Schur polynomials (of a finite number of variables) are Schubert polynomials; any Schur can be reconciled with a given permutation with one descent, which corresponds to a Schubert polynomial. \\

\textit{Additional Info: Schubert polynomials can be realized through pipe dreams or rc-graphs, perhaps a topic for further reading.}
