\subsection{Weekly Summary}

Monday, June 3rd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked through Sheet 3 (Schubert polynomials introduction, Schubert polynomials in $Fl(3)$, relating Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{S}$ in the basis of Schubert polynomials with partitions and Schur polynomials).
    \item Read potential projects background
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Points of Dicussion for June 4th, Tuesday Meeting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we determine a basis of Schubert polynomials for a general flag manifold?
    \item How can we reconcile the Schubert polynomials with the Schurs (which permutations correspond to which partitions)?
\end{itemize}
