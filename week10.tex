Monday, July 22nd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Came up with conjecture for $F_p^k$ terms (extending Lenart Maeno) in Grassmanians
    \item Confirmed conjecture for $Gr(1, 5), Gr(2, 5), Gr(3, 5), Gr(4, 5)$ and the corresponding Chevalley relations (very excited as this could be new!)
\end{itemize}

Tuesday, July 23rd
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with Linda to discuss progress on guesses/Grassmanians and next steps (testing in larger ambient spaces/automating the process)
    \item Discovered first working guesses for $F_p^k$ in $Fl(1, 2, 4)$ and $Fl(1, 3, 4)$ -- all Chevalley satisfied!
    \item Next step: test Grassmanian conjecture against $Gr(3, 6), Gr(4, 7), Gr(4, 8)$ (create way to automate this process), and above guesses for $Fl(2, 3, 4)$ and other partial flags (again, find a way to automate this process).
\end{itemize}
